# Meta-Stock-Price-Analysis
Meta stock price analysis involves examining historical price data, identifying trends, and understanding market factors influencing the stock. The process includes:

Data Collection: Gather past stock prices, trading volumes, and external economic indicators.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, extracting relevant features.
Model Training: Use machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Random Forests, or LSTM networks to train models on the preprocessed data for stock price prediction.
Model Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using evaluation metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Prediction and Analysis: Utilize the trained model to forecast future stock prices, aiding in informed trading decisions and future stock performance forecasting.
This comprehensive approach leverages historical data and machine learning to provide valuable insights and predictions for Metaâ€™s stock price.
